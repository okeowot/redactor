#PROJECT DESCRIPTION: THIS PROJECT DESIGNS A SYSTEM THAT ACCEPTS PLAIN TEXT DOCUMENTS, DETECTS AND REDACTS SENSITIVE ITEMS. THE ITEMS TO REDACT WOULD BE ALL NAMES, ALL DATES, ALL ADDRESSES, ALL GENDERS, ALL PHNONE NUMBERS.

#TO RUN THE PROGRAM, JUST NAVIGATE TO THE PROJECT1 FOLDER WHICH IS IN THE CS5293SP23 DIRECTORY AND RUN PIPENV RUN PYTHON REACTOR.PY --INPUT SAMPLEFILE.TXT --NAMES --GENDERS --ADDRESS --DATES --PHONES --OUTPUT FILES --STATS STDERR

#ASSUMPTIONS MADE: FOR MY ADDRESSES, I ASSUMED ALL ADDRESS WOULD BE IN FORM (NUMBER(WHICH COULD BE 1 OR MORE NUMBERS) FOLLOWED BY A WORD AND AN OPTIONAL SPACE AND THEN ANOTHER WORD). FOR MY GENDERS, I MADE A LIST OF ALL THE POSSIBLE GENDERS THAT EXIST AND USE THOSE TERMS TO SEARCH THE DOCUMENTS AND REDACT IT IF THE TERMS EXISTS.  

#THE PROGRAM WORKS BY TAKING IN THE REDACTION FLAGS WITH THE INPUT FILE. I DON'T HAVE ANY FUNCTIONS FOR SPECIFIC THINGS. EVERYTHING IS WRITTEN IN THE SAME FILE. WHEN THE INPUT IS GIVEN, IF IT IS A GLOB OF FILES, THE FILES ARE FIRST PUT IN A LIST OF ALL THE FILES, THEN THE FILES ARE READ INTO A VARIABLE CALLED TEXT. IF STATEMENTS WERE USED FOR ALL THE REDACTION FLAGS. IF ANYOF THE REDACTION FLAGS WERE PRESENT, THE IF STATEMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE REDACTION FLAG IS ACTIVATED AND THE CODE UNDERNEATH THE IF STATEMENT IS PERFORMED. IF THE NAMES FLAG IS PRESENT, TEXT IS PUT IN AN NLP OBJECT AND ASSIGNED TO DOC. A MATCHER PATTERN IS ALSO MADE USING THE ENTITY TYPE PERSON.THIS IS USED TO FIND THE NAMES OF A PERSON. I ALSO HAVE A VARIABLE THAT KEEPS TRACK OF ALL THE NAMES THAT GOT REDACTED AND PRINTS IT IN THE STATS FILE. FOR THE GENDERS, A FOR LOOP GOES THROUGH THE GENDERS DEFINED AND COMPARES AND REDACTS THE GENDERS FOUND. I ALSO HAVE A VARIABLE THAT STORES ALL THE GENDERS FOUND AND THOSE GENDERS ARE PRINTED IN THE STDERR FILE. FOR NUMBERS, ADDRESSES AND DATES, I MADE A LIST THAT CONTAINED ALL VARIOUS PATTERNS FOR EACH OF THOSE REDACTION FLAGS. USED A FOR LOOP ON EACH OF THOSE PATTERNS AND CALLED A RE.SUB FROM REGEX TO SUBSTITUTE THE PATTERNS FOUND WITH â–ˆ. FOR THE FILES TO BE SAVED WITH .REDACTED, I USED THE OS FUNCTION TO FIND THE BASENAME OF THE FILE THEN I ADDED THE .REDACTED TO THE FILE NAME. AFTER THAT, I WROTE THE REDACTED TEXT INTO THE FILE WITH THE WITH FUNCTION. MY TEST FILE IS NOT WORKING LIKE I WANT IT TO SADLY. THE TEST CASES ARE THE HARDEST PART.
