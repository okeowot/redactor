Thanks for rounding up the tickets for the Orange Bowl.  You can mail them to 
me, or just hold them until I see you after Christmas.  ████ 's ████ decided 
not to make the trip, so ██ won't be using the tickets.  ████  █████  will use 
the other two tickets.  

█████  during the week between Christmas and New Years sounds great to me.  I 
will be working that week, but would be glad to meet you guys at Champions 
for █████  if that is best.  Or if you are game for ████ 's, just let me know 
when you would like to come downtown.

█████ /████ ,

I will be in Houston the week after Christmas (12/26-12/29) and was
wondering if the two of you were going to be in the office, and if so, would
you be available for █████ ? In talking with █████  ████ , ██ was going to try
to arrange a golf game (████ , me, ███████  █████████  and █████ ) one of those
afternoons at Champions. If that is possible, then maybe █████  before golf
might work. If not, then I can meet you downtown when convenient. Let me
know what your schedules are like and I will plan my schedule accordingly.

Also, I need to know if I need to mail the Orange Bowl tickets to both of
you separately or just one of you. Didn't know if you are planning on going
to Miami together? I should receive the tickets in the next day or two and
will do whatever. Ought to be a fun trip, as it has definitely been awhile
since the Sooners have been to Miami.

Anyway, let me know if you are available for █████ /gold or just █████ .

Hope you all have a wonderful holiday season and most of all get to spend
time with your families!
